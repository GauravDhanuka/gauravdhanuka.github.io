<p class="message">
  Hey there! I am Gaurav Dhanuka. I am a passionate designer and a full-stack web developer.

<img src="{{ page.image }}"/>



Previously, I learned C language as per my academics requirements. But, when I started learning *Ruby*, it turned out to be my favourite language. 

Further, I learned *Ruby on Rails*. I started developing web-applications. Developing Web-apps was an awesome experience.


Loves an open source and free software. Mostly, Inspired by a software programmer(big bro to me) [Aruz Parazuli](https://twitter.com/aruzmeister) and an awesome person *"Makenzie Child"*.


As to my academics study, I am pursuing my undergraduate study in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Allahabad(Third year).
